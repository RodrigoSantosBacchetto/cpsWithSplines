## Description

The **Contour-Point Signature Experiment Project** is a set of C++ components
(libraries) and command line tools that conform a development and test-bench
environment for computer vision applications based on the “Contour-Point
Signature” (CPS) feature descriptor. The project was developed by the
*Scientific and Applied Computing Laboratory* at the *National University of
Asunción*, Paraguay.


### What this toolset does?

The Contour-Point Signature is a feature [point] descriptor used in shape
registration, with applications in the fields of shape matching, retrieval,
classfication, clustering, object recognition and similar computer vision
applications.

Primarily, this tool set allows for the computation of the set of CPS features
descriptor for a given silhouette, and perforn a registration of two point sets.
Additionally, there are tools for shape matching, shape retrieval, and object
recognition.

#### What are not supported (yet)?

There are neither support (yet) for shape classification nor shape clustering
using CPS feature descriptors.


### Testing environments

The source code was tested using settings for C++98, C++03, and C++11 standards,
with:
* Microsoft 32-bit and 64-bit C++ compilers:
  - Visual C++ 2012 (Visual Studio + Windows 7)
  - Visual C++ 2013 (Visual Studio + Windows 8)
* GNU 32-bit C++ compilers:
 - G++ 4.7.0 (GCC + Fedora 17)
 - G++ 4.7.2 (GCC + MinGW 3.20-2 / Windows 7)
 - G++ 4.8.2 (GCC + Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1)
 - G++ 4.9.2 (GCC + Cygwin 1.7.35 i686 / Windows 7)

So, it should port readily to any modern platform.

Binaries was tested under:
* MS-Windows/DOS
  - Windows 7 (32bit and 64bit)
  - Windows 8 (64bit)
  - Cygwin 1.7.35 over Windows 7 (32bit)
  - MinGW 3.20-2 over Windows 7 (32bit)
* UNIX-like
  - FreeBSD 10.1 (32bit)
  - Linux Fedora 17 (32bit)
  - Linux Ubuntu 4.8 (32bit)

Probably, it will work on any BSD distro, OS/X, and other UNIX like
operating systems with a Standard ISO C++ compiler, in 32-bit and
64-bit environments.

## IDEs and Workspace Files

This project contains several IDEs flavoured workspace autogenerated files.


### Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2012 (Visual C++)

AppWizard has created the CPSignature solution and project files. No source
files were created as part of the projects.

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| CPSignature.sln | Visual Studio (VS) Solution. This is the main solution file for VS projects generated using an Application Wizard. It contains information about the version of Visual Studio, and information about the projects within the solution. |
| CPSignature.v11.suo | Visual Studio Solution User Options. |
| CPSignature.sdf | Solution Database. |
| *.vcxproj | Visual C++ (VC++) Project. This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the Application Wizard. |
| *.vcxproj.filters | Visual C++ Project Filters File. This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. It contains information about the association between the files in your project and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the "Source Files" filter). |


### NetBeans® C/C++ IDE 8.0.2

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ./nbproject/ | NetBeans Project settings folder. |
| Makefile | Standard Makefile file. |


### Eclipse™ Luna R2 C/C++

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ./.settings/ | Eclipse Project settings folder. |
| .project | Project file. Contains global project configurations. |
| .cproject | C/C++ Project file. Contains configurations for the C/C++ compilers. |


### Code::Blocks C/C++

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| CPSignature.cbp | CodeBlocks C/C++ project workspace. |
| CPSignature.layout | Project Explorer layout file. |
